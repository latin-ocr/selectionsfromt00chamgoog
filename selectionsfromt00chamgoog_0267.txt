Tacitus gives an account in bis History (42 5), sves a senator, end
was condemned to death by the senate (at the dictation ol thaeus·
peror, of noune), under the pretext that he had represented in c
farre, under false names, the domestic infelicities ol Domitian und
his wife. Tacitus being a member oi the senate speaks oi himself
as having been compelled to take a part in this horrid deed of con·
demning to death a fellcw senator-noc . . . perfuditl. Rusti·
cus (as we have seen, sec. 2), was condemned to death for eulogizing
Paetus Thrasea, and Senecio ior eulogizing Helvidius Priscus. On
the contramilitantem· brother ol Rusticus, was only banisbed.
Perfudit, the common predicate of visne (‘⁴ the sight ''), and Senecio,
means with the first “struck with horror,'’ and with the last
'‘sprinkled.'' This is zeugma (see Intr. mlh-cum. . . subscrib-
