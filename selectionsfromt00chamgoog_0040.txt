THE STYLE OF TACITUS.

5 116. Tacitus has many peculiarities in his anonyement os wuda.
The cognomen is sometimes placed before the gentile name; aa,
Secundus Pomponius, Massa Bebins, Gallus Asinius. This was rare
in strictly classical writers, but began with Livy, and is particularly
common in Valeius. The designation ol the office sometimes pre
cedes the name3 as, imperator Augustus, Caesar Titus, procurator
Marius, etc. This is rare in Cicero and Casan-Most frequent is
his transposition of the preposition from its proper place before its
word to some other position, called Anastrople. He places it not only
aiter the pronouns ln'c or qui, which is common in classical writers, but
sometimes in his History, and often in the Annals, places it after:

(n) Α noun without an attribute: humantis ultra, Tiberim

juxta, senatu coram, praeturam intra, paucas inter, humum infra,
