2. Adueraatioe conjunctione.

ξ d'l. Non modo—sed (without etiam or qnoque), found only iu the ⁴
larger works oi Tacitus, was spariugly used by Cicero and Sallust,
und commonly used only after the time of Livy. We also lind sed et
instead oi sed etiam in Ann. l: 12; 14: 213 Germ. 17, 35, 45.

In other places in the History and Annals we flnd non modo or non
solum followed merely by etiam or petoque without aad : us, Η. 2: 27;
Anu. 3: 19, 4: 35; once also in Livy.

3. Disjunctivs Conjunctions.

5 68. Vel instead oi aut.- oblivione vel gloria (Η. l: 21); vel si
relinqueretur (Anu. 13: 41); vincendum vel cadendum (Ann. 14: 35).
Sine instead of ant: se Vitellio sive Othoni obsidem iore (H. 2: 1).
Vel-sive: Dialog. 5. Siue-anesius fatali vecordia an-ratus (Anu.
11: 26). Oiten siva instead oi sive-sive.

The interchange oi the particles is only apparant inAnn.14: 7,
sive servitia armaret vel militem accenderet sive, etc. Here uel is
subordinate to the sive, and not its coordinata. So in Anu. 14: ot
(εἰη-ειη), Η. 3: 8 (τιεί-ειη), 2: 41 (an-vel).

4. Consul conjunctione.

569. uanique is found in the Annals before vowels as well as
before consonante. It stands after one or more words in its sentence
in Ann. 1: 5& 4: 21, as in the poets, also in Livy and the later
wrltlilernsrpe enim only in Dialogue 35. As a like pleonasm we find in
aiter times: nempe ergo, nempe igitur, quia enim, quod euim, ergo
igitur.

5 70. The genuine asyndeton, denoting tlte rapid progress of an
action, and used more or less by all historical writers, was a great
favorite with Tacitus (see Ann. 1:28, 41, 64, 70; 2: 19; 15: 69). It
was also often employed by him in giving an outline statement oi
iacts (aa in Η. 122), or in a brief skctch oi a case in indirect dis·
course, as in Ann. 3:69.

5 71. Enumerative asyndeton.

(1) Simple enumeration of particulars without teudinp to a clinans:
munia senatus, magistratuum, legum; iilius, collega, imperii con·
