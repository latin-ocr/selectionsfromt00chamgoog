ξ 117. Tacitus by anastrophe often gives conjunctione a post-pesi-
tion, instead oi their usual one before the word or at the beginning ot
the sentence which they connect; viz, namque, qnippe, quanquam,
quin etiam, immo, quin immo, siquidem, dum, donec, ut, quem,
quum-Tne later writers abound in this more, but there are ex·
amples of it also in the classical period. Thus we dud αἱ as the
seventh word in its sentence, and quum as the niuth word eren
in Cicero.

ᾖ 118. Order os sentences ond structure of periods. Although ihu
relation ol the subordinate sentences to the principal sentence is

generally correct, yet occasionally his style is rendered heavy by u
accumulation of subordinate clauses after the principnl sentence:
aa, insignis dde, et amisso per vulnus oculo, paucis ante annis, duce
Tiberio (Ann. 2: 913 legionarios obtrivit, uno tantum centurione
turrim, in qna praesidium agebat, defendere auso, factaque saepius

eruptione, et caesis qui-suggrediebantur, donec-subveniretur
(15:12). The like also in Anu. 15: 45, 2: 21; Η. 2: 11.
