cording to the system of Schmidt. Second Edition. tomo, cloth,

Prof. N. L. Andrews, Madisoa Uaiuersity, N.Y.-I have examined
witlr great care Professor Mather’s edition of tlte Prometheus. The
notes are well adopted to the literary appreciation of the play, and the
Introduction, with its graphio and interesting sketch of the representation ’
of Greek drsmss, is a valuable feature. Ι shall adopt it for use with my
classes.

Prot. T. L. Seip, lifullenbery Colleye, Pa-The Introduction is very
raluahle to tlre student, and meets a want seldom supplied in similar
works. The article on the lyrie parts, and the metrical scheme, fumish in
concise form much-needed information. The text is very good, and the
notes ere a satisfactory aid for beginners in Greek Tragedy.

The text of this edition is mainly that of Diodorf. In the notes brevity
has heeu studied, as short notes are more likely to be read, and, therefore, to
be useful. Each play is preceded by an Introduction aad an Argument.

President Felton, by his tastes and his studies, was especially fitted for
the difficult tssk of editiog Aristophanes, and the notes of these two books
show with what skill and tlroronghness the congeniti labor has been per-
formed. Great care llas been taken to explain tlte judicial expressions and
tlte frequent allusione to the political and socisl life of Athens. In the new

editions the commentary hasbeen enlarged by references to Goodvriu’s
Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb. ,
