Xenophon’s Memorabilia. With Introduction and Notos, by

Professor Sauum Ross Wruarvs, College ol New dersey. ldmo,
289 pages. ΜΟ.

The text is separated into convenient divisione by English summaries,
which take the place ol the customary argument prefixed to the chapters,
and put a logical analysis of the text where it cannot escape the attention
oi the student. The nutes are designedly compact. yet are believed to con·
tuin all that is practically uselul to the student. The editor has endeavored
to supply brief sketches ol everything of biographical, historical, or philo·
sophical interest. ’

Proi. Α. C. Merriam, Columbiu Collepe, Now Yorl·.- It supplies a
want long felt, and I have no doubt will be largely used, as it deserves.
The introduction ol the summaries into the text adds greatly to its valuc,
while the notes are succinet, with good references and apt illustratione.

Ptol. C. Μ. Moss, Wesleyoa Uaiaersil'ts, luctuu- The notes are ex·
cellent, the paragraphing of the text is a great and valuable help to stu-
dents, and the book itsell is a model of neatness. Itis one of the lew
unexceptionably well-edited school-books in my library. I shall use it in
my classes exclusively when we read the “ Memorabilia.”
