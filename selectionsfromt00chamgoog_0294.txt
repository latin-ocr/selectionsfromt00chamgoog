Prot. charles Chandler, Derrison (haitanda, Granor'lle, otta-1 consider
the Selections to be an excellent and long-needed book. Ishall use it
more or less every term from the beginning of Freshman year. For reading
at sight it is just the thing that I have wanted, and, in connection with the
study oi the development of Roman Literature, such a book will be highly
interesting aud profitable. I have always maintained that it is a flat, male,
and unprofitable task for the student to read abolit the productione of Latin
authors, without at the same time studying the productioris themselves.

Proi. J. H. Hewitt, W illimus Colleye, Willr'omstowrr, Mosa—The Selec-
tions have been made with discretiori, not only in that they are interesting
in themselves, but in that they are such aa to show the peculiarities oi the .
thought and style ol the several writers. The book cannot fail to bo usesul
as a manual cf exercises for translation at sight, aud also as a text-book in
connection with instruction in the history of Latin literature.

Proi. Tracy Peck, Yale Collega, Nero Horren, Gonu. - The plan seems to
me to be carried out with excellent judgment and tacte. This work cer-
tainly gives in succinet aad attractiva form a clear· view of Roman literature
throughout its best periodo
