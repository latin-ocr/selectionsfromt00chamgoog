The First and Second Courses contain careiully graded extracts'
from Jules Veros, Erckmann-chatrian, Ε. About, Beranger‚ Louis

Blanc, Alexandra Dumas‚ Balzac, Lamartine, Victor Hugo, and other
modern writerS, together with complete vocabularies3 thus affording

· interesting instruction in reading in addition 'to the usual translation

oi exercises. The last book oi the series contains a long list of French
idioms and phrases, arranged in sections, with exercises ior translation
and retranslation on each section.

Prot. Schele De Vere, Unicersr'ty os Virginis—After a painstaking
examinationi can endorse Chardenal's Frenclr Course as the work of an
experienced‚ highly-gifted toacher. The J uniorand the Adranced Courses are
admirably arranged, and cannot fail to bring the student almost impercep-
tiny forward, till teacher and pupil alilre feel that the task is accomplished.
Among new features the carefully chosen vocabularies, and above all the
collection of idioma deserve special commendation. Iam sure the volumes
need only to be well known to be very generally adopted.

Proi. Henry Johnson, Bowdoin Colleqe, illd—They are excellent text·
books, and a toacher who would speak French to and with his class could
not fail to use them with great advantage. 1 use them in our advanced
class here.

Proi. A, Μ. Elliott‚ Jotns Hoplcr'ns University, Md. - We have adopted
both the Adranced and First Courses in our work in this University. I like
them better than anytlring else 1 have seen in English.

Proi. S. B. Platner, Adelbert Colleye, otro-1 am using Chardenal’s
Series with my classes, and am exeeedingly well pleased with the books.
They are by far the best that 1 know of lor the purpose intended.

Prot. nicee Fortier, Taleae Um'cersity, New Oricum—I find the books
excellent, and well suited to give to the pupil a praeacutas well as a theoreti-
cal, knowledge os the language.

Prot. Karcher, Royol Mr'lirory Acodemy, Woolwich.-Le recueil d'exer·
cices public par M. Chardenal repond parfaitement, selon moi, au but que
l’auteur se propose. . . . En un mot, ces exercices apprendront aux e‘leves
tparler franceis, au lieu de se servir de phrases litteralement traduites de
l'anglais.

Prot. Ch. cassat, LL.D., University Collega, London. -Je puis vous dire
en toute sincerite, que vous avez fait un travail hon et utile. Le recueil
d'expressions idiomatiques est excellent et serait t lui seul le succes de rotro
livre.
