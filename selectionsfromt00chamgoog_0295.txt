Lucretium De Rerum Natura Libri Sex. With an Introduc·
tion and Notes to Books l.‚ 111, aud V, by Theseis W. Kaisar,
M.A., Professor oi Latin iu Lake Forest Uuii'ersity. tomo,
444 pageS, «illiti.

Prot. Saml. Hart, Trinitp Collega, Harmod—It isa most excellent edi·

tion, and, coming at a time when reuewed interest is l'elt iu the doctrines
and writings ol' Lucretius, its publication rucets a real want.

Prol. C. J. Hatris, Waslrlaploa aad Lae Um'rerst'tp, lta—It isan admi· ’

rable edition¹ and will be thoroughly helplul in the difficult work of devel-
oping the school-boy into the scholar. The editor has caught much of the
enthusiasm ol his author, and the wide and varied reading which he has
brought'to bear upon his work, aud his fresliness and vigor oi treatment,

cannot hut prove verystimulating to earnest and ambitious students. , ’

Ptol. L. S. Potwin, adelbert Collepe, Cleceland, O.-I like it much, and
think it not only well annotated, but also prepared on the true theory,
viz.: to give the whole text, and notes on a part. This gives a chance for
independent study on a portion, aud practice in reading at sight.

Persius The Satires3 with Notes, based on those of Macleane
and Conington, by the Rev. Sauusu Haar, tta, Professor in
Trinity College, Hartiord. Mimo, 91 pages, 3055.

The text of this edition agrees iu most places with that otJahn. In the

arguments prefixed to each satire, the editor has endeavored to give a ·

suggestive outline of the poet's thoughts, and in the notes. to point out aa

clearly as possible the connection of one idea, or oue part oi the poem, with
another.

n1s‚ll'illiams Collega hlass. Third Edition. 16m0‚180pages‚

Ptol. J. E. Goodrich‚ University os Varrone-It is the best American
edition ol any play of Plautus.

Prot. Α. G. HopkinS, Ilamilton Collega, Naso rorte-Your edition oi
the Mostellaria by Morris is elegant in appearance, and hasa scholarly
tinish to it which no American edition of Plautus has hitherto shown. The
Introduction is tuh aad interesting; the tert is a model ol typographical

beauty; and the notes explain to the young student all the difficulties aad
peculiarities os the text.

Prot. John K. Lord‚ Dartmoatlt Colleqe, N. H.-I think the notes jndi-

⁰l⁰l¹¹⁸’ correct, and well ‹ligested, giving the right kind of informatiou iu the
rig rt way.
