§ 121. The 1000110 1001001000, springing from his virid and ener-
getie conoeptiou 01 things, and without a parallel in all ancient litera·
ture, is attained hy means 01 Ellipses, Participial and (lo-ordinate
constructions, the Asyndeton, the disregard 01 Concinnity,and the dis·
dain 01 rhetorical Fulness.-lnstanees 01 Ellipsis are found in the
frequent omission 01 small words, the prepositions and conjunctione,
the forms 01 esse and 01 verbo dicendi et motandi (§§ 20, 21).

No writer so abounds 10 what is called the propheat Μαι-1101101001
which more is implied than is actually expressed: as, jus legationis
(sc. violatum) miseratur (Ann. 1: 39), pericula (= societatem peri·
culorum) polliceri (2; 41)); reipublicae injurias (ie. reniam injuri-
arum) ne largiretur (3: 70); exemit etiam Drusum dicendae primo
loco sententiae (necessitati), 3: 223 proruunt fossas l: terra proruta
explent), l: 6& plerumque permoveor (sc. ad opinionem) nuru (4²
11ης Nero non prius differi potuit (= adduci ut differet), 13: 203

’ exitium irritare (ε iram ad exitium), 13: 1; 14: 3.

Not less a favorite with him is the 100900, by which the meaning
01 a word is strained to make it do double service: as, cibos et hor·
taurina gestant (Germ. 7); Agr. leand 44; quia Romanis Germanis·
que idem conducere et pacem quam bellum probabam (Anu. 1: 58);
quod arduum sibi, cetera legatis permisit (2; 20); juxta gratiam
aut fastus janitorum perpetiebantur (4² 74t; ac primo, etc. (42 72);
manus ac supplices voces ad Tiberium tendens (after virgil), 2: 293
eum voces, cum manus intentarent (3: 36). Thus often, especially
in the Annals.

A decided characteristic 01 Tacitus is his frequent use 01 the
participio! construction. In order to see this, we have but 10 compare
him with the earlier writers as to the number 01 such 0000110011οω
found in the same extent 01 simple narrative 01 a lilre nature. From
such a comparison, it appears that, while Caesar in the two hundred
words 01 1110 tirst two sections 01 the second book 01 his Gallie War
has but five participial constructione, and Sallust in Jug. 6-7 only
ten, and Livy in 21: 5 sixteen, Tacitus in Αο0. 2: 11-12 hu
twenty-four.

ᾖ 122 The nietaplor, by which words are applied fipnrotlvely 10
subjects similar in some respect to those in which they have a literal
application‚ is very much used by Tacitus, and greatly enlivens his
narrative, though occasionally appearing a little tar-ietched. nis
