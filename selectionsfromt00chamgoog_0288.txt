Prof. J. E. Goodrich, blo‘eawirp os Vonone. -Thcse Dialogues of Lucian
are just the thing for rapid reading or for reading at sight. Lucian
11 soalert,so keen, and witlral so modern in feeling and temper, that the
student is driven to read 01 and 01, just to see how the witty (lebate will
end. Iam glad to see that Professor Williarns has furnislred an edition
which will fully rneet the demands of the class-raom.

Prof. Henry M. Baird, Unicersily of tlte Cdp of Nero lbra-A con·
venient edition of Lucian 1111 long been needed. 'l'he want has now been
met by Professor Williams's industry and scholarship, and l have no doubt
thatthe book will be dnly appreciated. 'Phe editor has collected in his intro·
duction all that is most essential for the student to know respecting the
author of the dialogues and respecting the dialognes themselves; while the
notes show a most judieious choice between the extremes of too great ful-
ness and barrenness of illustration. The typography and external appear·
auce are nnexceptionable.

Moss's first Greek Reader. With Introduction, 110111,

It is the aim of the author to fnrnish a Greek book for beginners which
shall he simple and interesting, and at the same time contain a 111111111-
ber of such words, phrases, and idioms as are of frequent occurrence in
Attio Greek. There has for some time been a demand for such a book, to
precede the Anabasis, which is of nneven difficulty, and which 11 quite apt,
when read slowly by a beginner, to grow very tedicus.

The book contains no disconnected sentences. It consists of a series of
earefully graduated exercises for translation, beginning with the simplest
stories, and ending with extracta from Xenophon, Herodotus, and suetan,
which have been changed and adapted to the knowledge of the beginner.
The text is preceded by valuable hints on translation, and followedby
notes and a complete vocabulary.

It is believed that the time spent 11 reading this book, before taking up
any Greek author for consecutive study, will be ruore than saved in tho
subsequent rapid progress of the pupil.
