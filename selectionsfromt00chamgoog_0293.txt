]ο1111 8. white, LL.D.‚ [leod-.l[osler Berkelep School, Nero Yorlc Caly.-
Comstock's Latin Book l find the best book for its purpose that 1 have ever
used. The review of English Granrmar at the beginning3 the separation
of the vocabularies from the exercises; judicious and progressive presen-
tation of the various uses of the verb in the different moods; and the con·
densed exhibit of the grammon—are such raluable features gathered
within the covers of a text-book, that it has no rival.

Nathan Thompson, A.M.‚ Principol [1111111111 Acheloon, Grecos, Mass.
—lt is altogether the best Latin book for beginners with which 1 am
acquainted.

Gso. B. Turnbul, Colpole Acod„ flandren, N..Y. -I am using Com·
stock’s First Latin Book with the lunior Closs, and find it even more
satisfactory than I had hoped.

Prof. E. Alexander, University os Tennessee, Knoxoille.-Comstock’s
Latin Book is in use in our preparatory department, and is perfectly
satisfactory. A better text-hook is not often seen.

Prof. H. C. Missimen Hiplt Sciool, Erie, Fra-It is very easy to see
that Comstock's First Latin Book is the work of a thorough toacher,
who has had actual experience in the class-roem with the difficulties which
beginners in Latin usually meet. Its classification and methodo are thor·
ough and complete; its language is clear and sirnplc. Mr. Comstock has
hit the nail on the head. lle knows just what and just how much grammar
is needed for good, clean work. We have had Leighton and Jones, -hoth
good, -but we like Conistock more, because it is better.

Chas. P. Pariter, Horcord Collepe.-Chase’s Macleane's Horace Ι have
long known and used, and have found it thoroughly satisfactory both in
study and in teaching.

Prof. Herbert W. Smyth, Williams Callope, Mosa-I arn glad to
express my cornmendation of Macleane’s Horace as republished by you.
Io scholarly character places it at the head of all editions used in schools,
while its just discrimination in the selection of notes adds materially to its
usefulness.

Prof. J. H. Chamberlin, Motella, orta-1 recommend Mecium
lorace to my classes. It is a most excellent edition.
