ANNALS, BOOK I.

Iuraonucroar Nora-Annam are a briei history by years.
There is little anticipation or retrospection in annals; while in history
the past, the present, and the future are all blended into a single pictura
to represent a period. At the beginning of each new year in the
Annals, Tacitus names the consuls, aud then relates the wars, the

foreign proceedings, the acts oi the Senats and oi the Emperor dur· ο

ing the year. In his History, too, he names the consuls, but min·
gles with present events anticipatione oi the future-as in regard
to the approaching accession and glory ol the Flaviau Dynasty - and
illustrations irum the past. From this it follows that history is a
more elaborate and artistic work than annals, which holds true oi
the History and Annals oi Tacitus; though in places the style is more
highly wrought and artificia! in the Annals than in the History. There
were originally sixteen books oi the Annals, giving the history of the
downiall of the Julian Dynasty, through Tiberius, Caius (Caligula),
Claudius, aud Nero. Oi these books, the tlrst six, containing the
history of the reign oi Tiberius, are entire, with the exception of the
fifth. Then follows a gap to the eleventh book ς and aiter this most
oi the books are quite incomplete, large parts oi some oi them having
been lost. The Annals seem to have been published about an. 116,
the latest oi his works.
