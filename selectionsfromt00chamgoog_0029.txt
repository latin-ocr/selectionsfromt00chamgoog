hut common in his other writings: as, hastas, saxa et facea3 socios,
cives et deos ipsos precor; atrox, avidum et societati impatiens.
This is avoided in writers of the classica! period, except when the
two members connected by et are viewed as one.

Et is found, also, as a connective in negative sentences: non proe-
lium et acies parantur; non satis expolitus et splendens ; nihil us·
qnam prisci et integri moris; non vox et mutui hortatus iuvabant.
In earlier writers nec, out, oc, or que was used in such cases.

Et (“also ’'), not used in this sense in Caesar, and very sparingly
in Cicero, is common in Livy, and a favorite with Tacitus and the
writers of his time. For the sake oi euphony jam et was always used
instead of jam etiam.

5 62. Et instead of wan after the words with a temporal meaning:
interim, nondum, necdum, jam, simul. In this, writers after Livy
imitated Virgil.

ξ 63. The copulative particles que, et, ac, atque are used interclcnpe·
ohly in the llistory and Annals: aa, Vulcano et Cereri Proserpinaeque ;
Tiberii Caiique et Claudii ac Neronis; Pharasmani Polemonique et ⁸
Aristobulo atque Antiocho; tetrarchis ac regibus praefectisque et
procuratoribus.

ς 64. Other peculiarities, occurring very rarely and only in his
larger works, are: et atii instead of alii-alii; necdum instead of non-
dum; ct quoque (used since the time oi Livy) and quoquc noa.

(h) coenaturum coronamus

§aa Instead of the regular correlative copulatives εΗ (both
and, so wellas also), we find occasionally the following:

(a) que-que, hut only in the Annals. Exceptions in tha classicat
writers and Livy, these are never found in Caesar and Suetonius.

(h) quc-et.- as, Agr. 18, H. 4: 2, 42, and eight times in the Annals ς
found also in Sallust, Livy, Velleius, and Curtius, hut not in Cicero,
Caesar, Suetonius, Nepos, Florus, and Justin. ln such cases que ia
always joined to ae, sihi, or ipse in Tacitus, hut with a noun in Livy.

(c) que-oc (atque) only in his larger works, and there only three
times, via, H. 3: 633 Ann. 4: 3 and 34: opibusque atque honoribus.
This does not occur in classical prose', and only once in Ovid, Livy,
and Curtius.

5 66. Ne-quidem for emphasis instead of neque: Germ. 7, 37, 443
Ha: 82; Ann. 1:4:prima ah infantia-neiis quidem annis. Found
only in Tacitus.
