Withont neglecting the grammatieal ‘ relations of
the language, something more than the usual atten-
tion has been paid to the thought and its rhetorical
presentation. Tacitus was a profound sooial and
politieal philosopher, with a wonderful insight into
the workings of human nature, and a marvellous
power of depieting these workinge in eharp senten·
tione language. llis thought is deep and suhtle, and
his words pointed and few. It is often diffieult to
find the thread of his diseourse, hut it ie eertain to
he golden when found. Indeed, much of the pleae·
ure derived from reading his works arisee from the
effert required to asoertain his meaning, which, glim-
men'ng ont from his wonderful words, like the light
from a eonsecrated grove, at onee arreete the atten-
tion, bnt often requires no inconsiderable etndy and
reflection fully to eomprehend it And, while ithae
not been attempted to deprive the reader of this
pleasure by profuse explanatione, it has been thought
beet here and there to give hints of the meaning and
translate obscure passages, in order to ensure a clear
understanding of the general scope of the narrative. -
