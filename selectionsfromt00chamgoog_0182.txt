of the. historical indultires insurgere and belm, and to be repeated in
the intermediate clause as the subject of pellexit ,· the last clauses

> being controlled by tlte oausal oum (quum),followed as usual by the

subj. (H. 517; A. dn G. 180, e.) It will be observed berc tbat eon·
junctions aud forms of esse are sparingly expressed‚ which is usual
with Tacitus (Intr. 20; 71). 'The Caesar hers referred to was Caius
Octavianus Caesar, afterwards known as Augustus (the great). lle
pursued and overcame Brutus and Cassius, the murdcrers of bis
uncle Julius Caesar, at Philippi (ao. tn); then orusbed out Sextus
Pompey (son ol Pompey the great), in a scs-fight ott Sicily (nc. ab),
while he set aside Lepidus from the triumvirate (eruto), and flrrnlly
subdued Antony, the remaining triumvir, at Actium, which lel't him
sole ruler ol the empire. As consul and tribune, he had the power
of assembling the senate and tlte people andei the veto, and grad-

tuum legum), retaining, however, the popular forms and designations
of public functionaries, as under tlte republio. By tlre distribution

or at a small price,-and the other means here referred to, he
quieted the different classes at Rome ; while, as the author goes on

single hand strong enough to quell tlre lactibus elentents and enforce
tbe laws against their violence, indigue, and bribery (vi, ambitu,
pecunia). It will be observed that, strictly, eo strapis is required before
opibnsr but it is often omitted by Tacitus (lntr. et).

We have in this section an admirable statement of the conditions
favorable to the establislrment of an absolute governrnent. At the
same time, the section is in striking contrast with the preceding
one, by the comprehensiveness‚ and indeed tlte complexity, of its
sentences; while thero tbe statements are of the simplest and most
transparent character.

3. Subsidia dominatloniL “as aids to his supremacy.” The
dat. of advantage depending upana noun is quite common in Taci-
tus (Intr. 32). The aidshere referred to were Marcellus (son of his
sister Octavia), Agrippa, Tiberius, and Drusus. He promoted (ex-
tulit) Marcellus to this position by making him pontifex and curule
edile (ie, superintendent of streets‚ temples, buildings, public works,
and gamesl; Agrippa, by granting him the consulship for two succes·
sive years (geminatus), and afterwards making bim bis son-in-law;
