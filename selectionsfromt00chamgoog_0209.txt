38. Forte an dolo ptdncsplsl. Nero was a man of triding, recis-

less character, utterly unfit t'or his position as emperor, leading a
dissolute and disreputablc life among actors, musicians, and the
abandoned classes; and hence liable to the suspicion of having
burned the city in his shameless folly and madness. Rome had been
wholly burned by the Gauls (Senones, 41), three hundred and sixty·
flve years after it was founded (sc. 389), and portions of it in 780
and istu an. 27 and 36 (see 4: ot; 6: 45). The present bumiug,
however, though only about two-thirds of the city were destroyed,
wass a much greater calamity (clades) than had yet befalleo it, on
account of the great extent to which the city had now attained3 it
being about thirteen miles iu circuit, and containing probably s mil·
lion and a half of inhabitants, and s very large number of costly
public buildings, with works of art and other forms of wealth innu-

of a city occupied, rather than of one divided-tsssa . . . ιοωι,
