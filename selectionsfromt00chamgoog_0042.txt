The structure of tle historieal period is often iujured by tbe use of
the coordinate instead oi the subordinate arrangement of the clauses,
often by a genial freedom of arrangement, and also by arranging his
matter aiter the form used by the old historical writers. He employa
very commonly that simplest oi arrangements, where a sinqb subor-
dinate sentence precedes the principal sentence ; as, quod postquam

Corbuloni cognitum est, ire praefectum -jubet (Anu. 13: 9). Very
common also is that arrangement, so usual with Livy, the participle,
the subordinate sentence, and then the principat sentence ,· as, interea
manipuli· missi, postquam turbatum in castris accepere, vexilla con-
vellunt. Very rarely two subordinate sentences not constected by a co
ordinate conjuaction precede the principal sentence: as, ubi ventum ad
aggerem, dum missilibus certabatur, plus vulnerum in nos et plerae-
que caedes oriebantur (nnn. 12: 35) ; also 1 : 35; H. 1:22. This last
arrangement oi sentences is not found in the older writers.

Tacitus only occasionally forms a complicated period, beginning
with an alternation of conjunctive sentences and participles, to
which the principal sentence, sometimes with a second succession oi
subordinate sentences, succeeds, so that one is reminded oi Livy in
the overburdened structure. The period in the second section oi
the first book of the Annals is something after this sort. So, also,
1: 6, quod postquam, etc. Here several subordinate sentences, with
an intervening parenthesis, precede; then follows the principal scu·
tenca-monuit Liviam-and then six more subordinate sentences.
Other complicated periods occur in Anu. 13: 54, illic per otium, etc.;

ς 119. Disreqard eff concinnity. While the classieal writers sought
to secure the perspicuity and harmony of their style by a uniform
construction of coordinata or corresponding clauses, Tacitus, iu
which he had been in some measure preceded by Livy, departed
from their rules in many ways, often intentionally‚ and, as it seems,
from disgnst at the prescribed form oi the schools. In place oi this
earlier uniformity, we find, especially in his larger works, a purposed
variety, where the author exchanges ior each other in different
parts oi a sentence or period:

(1) The cases: subsidio victis et terrorem adversus victores
(Anu. 12: 29); Spartanorum-Atheniensihus (3³ ton quasi impetus
antiqui et bona aemulatione (l3: 54); fessa aetate aut rudis pueri·
tiae (151 38); ut par ingenio, ita morum diversus tlt: 19); effusae
