18 LANGUAGE AND STYle ΟΕ TACITUS. Α

habetur, neque dubitabitur, neque dubitaverim, num dubitamus, nemo
dubitat,non ambigitur. The infin. with these negative expressions of
doubt are not found in Cesar and Sallust, and in Cicero only in Ad
Fam. 16, 21, 2, but are common in Livy and Nepos, and occasional
in Suetonius.

The accus. with the infin in modal and hypothetical sentences,
found in H. 1: 17, ut-acquiri, and Ann. 2: 33, nisisorts clarissimo cui-
que plures curas, eto, are Greek constructions.

5 81. Iudirect diaconiae is sometimes interruptcd by the use of the in-
dicative in subordinate sentences: as, abstulerat-fecere (Anu. 1: 10);
et quia-suberat (Anu 3: 6), and often. Not uncommou in Livy, and
abeunding in J ustin.

ἦ 82. The norninatt've wid tle infinitiva.

(a) With verbs: reliquiae consedisse intelligebantur; adventare
audiebatur5 neque dubitabantur praescripta3 additur scripsisse 3 an·
notatus praeriguisse; ceterae secuturae sperebantur; ariete, credito
vexisse Phrixum; Bosporum invasurus habebatur (Ann. 12:15).
Also with verbs oi siccusiap and wnaictr'np: defertur moliri res novas;
incusabatur facile toleraturus, and with sapui (also in Cicero), convinci,
compertus. The usage is much more extended in Tacitus than in the
earlier writers.

(b) With affectiosa and participial adiectives: certus, properus,
manifestus, suspectus, peritus, eruditus, facilis, factus, exercitus,
suetus. This usage, foreign to good prose and imitated from the
pocts, is rare even in the later writers.

ς 83. Indirsst questions. Here, like the writers of the silver age of
the language, aa is used much more frequently than nurus with an
ellipsis oi the verb only in his larger works, as in Ann. l? 13, casu aa
manibus ejus impeditus; also Anu. 1: 65, 2: 42 Very rare in strictly
classical authors.

5 84. ut qai, though generally followed by the subj, is found once
with the indic. (Germ. 22), as also in Livy and Curtius. And in
Agr. l8 we find quippe qui instead of ut qui.
