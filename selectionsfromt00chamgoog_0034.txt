dinem transferebat (Anu. 13: 45). Also with the general relative:
quoquo inclinarent (Anu. 3: 74). Very rare in strictly classical
authors, most frequent in Livy, Suetonius, and Nepos. '

586. Attracb'on into the case of the relatives ad ea quis (quibus)
maxime fidebant in populum Romanum officiis (instead of officia,
Ann. l: 56). This attractlon of the noun is rare in prose, but quite
common in the poets. But the attraction of the attribute into the case
of the relative is more common in classical authors: gladii, quos
praelongos (instead of praelonqi) regunt (Η. 1: 79); quae utrubique
pulchra (Ann. 6: 37).

5 87. The relative does not always apree witi its antecedent: raptis,
quod cuique obvium, telis (Η. 3: 80) ; legationes -quorum (= quarum
rerum) copia fessi patres (3ι 63). The neuter plural of the relative
is sometimes used thus by Cicero, and by Sallust and Livy in both
the singular and the plural.

0. Tauronnn Sanrnncas.

ξ 88. Α repeated action is often expressed by the subjunctive after
erravi, quaties, nbi, nt, but only in the History and Annals, and once
after nbi in Agr. 9. Only occasionally in Cicero and Livy, not at all
in Sallust and Velleins; but very frequently in the writers of the
silver age of the langunge, especially in Suetonius.

ξ 89. Postquam is found not only with the perfect, asin the earlier
writers, but often also with the imperfect nnd pluperfect ; and occa·
sionnllyv even with the present of the verbs videre, intelh'yere, and
habere (Ann. 14: 44).

§ 90. Dum (while) with tlre imperfect and perfect, as in Cicero.
With the indicative of the present even lu indirect de'sconrse, as it had
been before by Livy and Curtius.

Dum sometimes has a coresol meonfnq (“ inasmuch as,'' “since '’):
dum afllrmant (Η. 1: 2213 dum vetera extollimus (Aura 2: 88).
Thus often in the Annals, rare in Cicero, but conmmn with the later
writers.

591. Donec (until) is often found with the subjunctive even
where a reality or fact is related. It almost supersedes the use of
quoad in Tacitus, which is found only in the meaning J‘as long as,''
aud that only in Ann. 4: 61, and 6: 51.
