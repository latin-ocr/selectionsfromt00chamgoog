Moss’s FIRST GREEK READER.

With Introduction, Notas, and Vocabulary‚ by Professor Catanes M.
Mose, Wesleyan University, lllinois. Mimo, 160 peges Revised
edition. lOeents.

It is thesim of the author to surnish a Greek book for beginners which
shall be simple and interesting, and at the same time contain a large num·
ber of such words, phrases, and idioms as are of frequent occurrence in
Attio Greek. There has for some time been a demand for such abook, to
precede the Anabasis, which is of uneven difficulty, and which is quite apt,
when read slowly by a beginner, to grow very tedicus.

The book contains no disconnected sentences. It consists of a series of
carefully graduated exercises for translation, beginning with the simplest
stories, and ending vvith extracts adapted from Xenophon, Herodotus, and
Lucian. The text is preceded by valuable hints on translation, and followed
by notes and a complete vocabulary.

It is believed that the time spent in reading this boolr, before taking up
any Greek author for consecutive study, vvill be more than saved in the
subsequent rapid progress of the pnpil.
