Prof. Α. Ρ. Montague, calamiten Unr'veist'ly, Waahinpton‚ D. 0.-1 am
using all the books ot' the Bennett Series in my various classes, and am
charmed with them. So far as my experience goes, they are hy iar the
best books of the kind now before the public, and I heartily commend
thern.

Dr. Α. C. Perkins, le'llrps-Ereter Arademy.—We take Bennett's “First
Latin Writer'' as the best Manurrl of Latin Composition for the first two
years oi our course. The “Easy Latin Stories‚’' by the same author, is
excellently fitted for pupils when they are beginning to read Latin.

Dr. H. T. Fallet, St. Johnslwry Academy, Vt-We have used Bennett's
“First Latin Writer'' for the last two years, and lind it eminently satis·
iactory. It involves aknowledgc of all the principles oi grammar and
Latin idionis, and, by a skilful selection of review work, obliges the pnpil to
keep what he has once acquircd. Its breadth of vocabulary is commendabis
in that it is not restricted to the words oi any single author.

Prof. C. L. Smith, Ilaraard Collega. -The “ Second Latin Writer'’ is
quite a useful book, and contains a very valuable collection of exercises.
The introduction gives the student sound advice, and many excellent notes
on idiom.
