are designed to be committed to memory. For this tlrcy are admira·
bly fitted by their brevity, their depth ol meaning, ancl rridc appli-
cability. Being apt and profound reflections on thc various alloirs

be equipped with no better or more usclul sumiture, hs history

similar in the experieuce oi lile, occasions will not be wanting ior

call the attention oi his pupila to these striking maxims, and explain
to thern the circumstances oi their original use and the applications
of which they arc susceptihle, and let the pupll con them till they
become as familiar aa household nordn he may be sure that he wlll
